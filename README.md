Here's a simple implementation of the Snake and Ladder game in Python using a text-based interface.
This implementation includes snakes and ladders at specific positions. Players take turns rolling a dice and moving forward accordingly. 
If they land on a snake, they move down, and if they land on a ladder, they move up. The game continues until a player reaches or exceeds position 100.
